Sailing is a very complex sport deeply based in physics also requiring a lot of tactics to analyze the best path to get around the course in a race. In my project, I created a wind tunnel with the Lattice Boltzmann method to analyze how much lift will be generated for different combinations of wind speed, boat angle and sail angle. I then applied the results to a generated wind vector field to optimize the path between one point and another.
